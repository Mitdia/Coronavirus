N:A211V
Changes at nucleocapsid position 211 experience both persistent (according to the FEL model of HyPhy) and episodic (according to the MEME model) positive selection as well as a rapid increase in frequency of non-reference variants. While the global frequency of 211V has remained low (no more than 0.3%), in Russia, it has increased from 0% in March to 22.86% in November. N:A211V is observed in 357 samples, all belonging to the PANGOLIN lineage B.1.1. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that it has originated in 9 independent events; one of them, which likely happened outside Russia, gave rise to 341 (95.5%) of Russian samples carrying this change, while the remaining eight occurred in Russia and together contributed to the 16 remaining sequences. According to immunoinformatic analysis, site N:211 is included in one of the four regions of the nucleocapsid protein with the highest affinity to multiple MHC-I alleles.
